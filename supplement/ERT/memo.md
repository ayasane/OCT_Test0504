The Emotion Recognition Task (ERT). ERT was developed20 and validated with neuroimaging30 and is part of the Penn CNB.19 The ERT presents subjects with photographs of pro- fessional actors (adults of varying age and ethnicity) portray- ing emotional facial expressions of varying intensities (biased toward lower intensities and balanced across the different ver- sions of the test). Subjects are given a set of emotion labels (“happy”; “sad”; “angry”; “fearful”; and “no emotion”) and must select the label that correctly describes the expressed emotion. The current implementation uses 40 consecutive stimuli, with 8 stimuli each representing one of the above 5 categories. ERT performance has been associated with amygdala activity in a variety of experimental contexts, showing its sensitivity to such diverse phenomena as menstrual cycle phase, mood and anxi- ety disorders, and schizophrenia.9,21 Additionally, sensitivity to hippocampal activation has been demonstrated when positive and negative emotional valence performance is analyzed alone (on a specific task only probing valence).21 The test has also shown sensitivity to sex differences and normal aging.15 The ERT was included in the Cognition battery because of its well- studied brain response and the importance of emotion identi- fication abilities to long-term social interactions. Emotional STROOP tasks have been administered in spaceflight, and show that at least some components of emotional processing are adversely affected by spaceflight.34
